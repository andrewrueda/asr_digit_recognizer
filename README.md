# HMM-GMM Spoken Digit Recognizer

## Overview
This is an HMM-GMM model for spoken digit recognition implemented from scratch using PyTorch and ESPnet2. `train.py` is set up for altering training configurations in the commmand line, such as number of states per HMM, and number of mel filterbanks during feature extraction.

There is also a simple Streamlit app included for demo-ing results of the model.

## Usage:
`streamlit run main.py`
